                        SWAYAM is a programme initiated by Government of India and designed to achieve the three cardinal principles
                         of Education Policy viz., access, equity and quality. The objective of this effort is to take the best teaching 
                         learning resources to all, including the most disadvantaged. SWAYAM seeks to bridge the digital divide for students
                          who have hitherto remained untouched by the digital revolution and have not been able to join the mainstream of 
                          the knowledge economy.</em></div>
